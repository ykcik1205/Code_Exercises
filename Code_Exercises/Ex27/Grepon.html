<IMG SRC="images/Grepon.jpg" HSPACE=5 ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=212>The Petit Grepon
is one of Rocky Mountain National Park's most challenging and awesome climbs.
Nestled in the middle of the Cathedral Spires, the summit of the Petit
Grepon is a mere ten by thirty foot perch, but "placemat" may be a better term.
For those who are more interested in a less intimidating climb, we also offer
tours up Sharkstooth, a nearby summit offering excellent views of the Petit
Grepon.
