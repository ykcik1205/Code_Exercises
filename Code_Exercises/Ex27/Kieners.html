of the most awesome climbs in the park, yet still very accessible to
the beginning climber, Kiener's Route is a Colorado Experience favorite. The
route starts at Mills Glacier and proceeds up a 1000 foot couloir known
as Lamb's Slide (ice axes and crampons required to climb Lamb's Slide.) Moving
off Lamb's Slide, you are led across Broadway, a narrow ledge varying in
width from several feet to six inches. The ledge overlooks a sheet of 
granite plunging down to Chasm Lake far below.
Proceeding up from Broadway, you will climb to the summit of Longs Peak 
following a route requiring climbing gear and climbing technique. Keiner's 
is one of North America's classic climbs.<BR CLEAR=RIGHT><BR>
