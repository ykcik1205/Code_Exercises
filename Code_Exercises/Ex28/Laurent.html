Maria returns to The Colorado Experience for her second year. She is a veteran
of Rocky Mountain National Park, having served as a backcountry ranger for
five years. When she's not climbing, Maria can be found entertaining tourists
with her guitar and her singing voice at Vale Park's most popular watering 
holes. Maria will be your tour guide on Lumpy Ridge, going up easy routes 
and hard.
